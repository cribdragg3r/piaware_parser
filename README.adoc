If you're using dump1090-fa on a Raspberry Pi to track aircraft movement, this package allows you to save aircraft information to your local system and/or AWS S3. 

Functionality to enrich your data with the https://rapidapi.com/adsbx/api/adsbexchange-com1/pricing[ADSBechanage API] gas also been added.

== How it works

Flight aware uses a dynamic json file `/run/dump1090-fa/aircraft.json` which is the base information you will see within your SkyAware Web dashboard. This package reads the data from the file, writes the data to a persistent gzipped CSV file, and continually checks for changes within `aircraft.json`. 

Essentially:

. Read `aircraft.json`
. Check if user has requested to use https://rapidapi.com/adsbx/api/adsbexchange-com1/pricing[ADSBexchange API].
.. This is to enrich the data if you do have access. 
. Write GZIPPED CSV data to a persistent file.
.. Filename is: `aircraft_<date>.csv.gz`
. Check if `aircraft.json` has new data.

== ADSBexchange API Feature

This package can use this api to add the following data points for each flight seen:

* flight Number
* Aircraft Registration
* Aircraft Type
* Is it Military
* Country of Origin

If you have an API key, use the `secrets.conf` to hold your value.

== How to use

* Python 3.8+
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* If you're going to use the ADSBexchange API, make sure to add you API key to `secrets.conf`
* If you want to upload your files to AWS S3, add your credentials to `secrets.conf`
